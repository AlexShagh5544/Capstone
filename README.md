# Fraud Detection Tool
Utilizing machine learning algorithms has proven to be a potent method for managing risk and preventing financial fraud. However, the requirement for coding expertise and deep knowledge of machine learning stands as a barrier for users who need such skills. This study offers an innovative, user-friendly framework that uses machine learning to address this difficulty. The paper studies the performance of three machine learning models, Random Forest, SVM, and XGboost, to classify, detect, and predict fraudulent transactions.
